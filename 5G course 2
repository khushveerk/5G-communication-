# 5G course 2

# standarization of 5G :-


## ITU-R --International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication 
Responsible to develp 5G requirements.

## latency -- 
    the delay between sending and receiving information. 

## mobility -- 
    Mobility in 5G refers to the ability of a user to remain connected to a network while moving around.

## Usage scenarioes :-

1> Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) :- Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) is a 5G service that offers higher data rates, lower latency, and better bandwidth to improve user experience.

2> Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) :- Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) is a 5G service category that allows for a large number of devices to connect online. It's designed to support the Internet of Things (IoT) by enabling high-speed, low-latency, and cost-effective communication for many devices with limited data rates.

3> Ultra Reliable And Low Latency Communication :-  it is a set of specifications for 5G mobile networks that enables low latency and high reliability for mission-critical applications.

**5G Architecture** :- 

Three main components 
 - UE (User equipment)
 - NG-RAN (Next Generation Radio Access Network)
 - 5GC (5G Core Network)
