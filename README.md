# 5G-communication-

# ITU (International Telecommunication Union) 
It is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating global telecommunication standards, regulations, and spectrum allocation. It ensures that communication systems worldwide, including telecommunications, radio, and satellite, operate seamlessly and without interference.ITU-R manages radio telecommunication, ITU-T sets technical standards for global telecommunications.

ITU - R -- Radio communication 
ITU -T -- Standardization 
ITU -D -- Development 

# 3GPP 
(3rd Generation Partnership Project) 
•It is a collaborative initiative that develops globally accepted technical specifications for mobile telecommunications. 3GPP defines system architectures, protocols, and standards for mobile networks and works closely with telecom companies and other stakeholders to drive the evolution of cellular networks.

# 5G Use Cases:

1. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)

   •provides high speed internet access     and low latency

 2.Massive Machine-Type Communications     (mMTC)
  
   •sports high density of online           devices
   •design to connect large number of       devices and IoT applications.

 3.Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency              Communication (URLLC)
   [key feature of 5G]  
  
   •provides low latency and highly         reliable communication 
   •example- for factory automation,        AR/VR , Remote surgery.etc 

## 4G LTE :- 
   a wireless technology that              provides high speed data.
   
  • LTE-- Long Term Evolution 
   (offers fastest mobile internet          experience) 

   
 # 5G Network Components:- 
 
 ## 1.UE --User Equipment                  •it means mobile device like tablet     laptop smartphone other wireless        devices that is used to access the      network
     
## 2.AMF --Access and Mobility Management Function 
   •manage user connections 
   •handles tasks like user                authentication mobility sport           helping devices switch between          different network areas smoothly.

## 3.UPF --User Plane Function 
   •responsible for handling the data       traffic that flows between users        and the internet
   •managers how data is transmitted 
   •acts as a bridge between user           devices and the data services they      access.

## 4.SMF --Session Management Function
   •responsible for setting up,             managing and terminating data           sessions for users.
   •(simply) heads to establish             connections for data services,          controls how data flows.

 ## 5.PCF --Policy Control Function       
   •determines how much data are used       can use privatisation certain types     of traffic and ensures the network     resources are allocated efficiently.
## 6.UDM --Unified Data Management
   • stores and managers user                information simply it keeps track       of user identities and preferences

## 7.RAN --Radio Access Network   
   •connects user devices to the core       network using radio signals and         enables faster data speed and low       latency.

# Difference between 4G and 5G :-

 •5G have became decentralized forgots    and very flexible. for example 5G       core function can now be co-located     with applications in an edge data       centre, making communication paths      short and thus improving end-to-end     speed and latency.

 •one more concept the distinguishes 5G   network architecture from 4G is *edge   computing*

 **edge computing**
 it refers to processing data closer to  wear it is generated, rather than       sending it all to a central server for  away. This reduces latency and          improves speed .


# Data Transmission:- 

1. ## Small cells and pico cells:-
   these are low power base stations       used in LTE advanced versions and 5G    technology to power devices in small    area like few 100 meters to 2 km

2. ## MIMO:-
   Multiple input multiple output

   •involves using multiple antennas at     both transmeter and receiver .It        allows for receiving and sending        more data at same time, improving       the speed.

3. ## Beamforming :-
    •it is a technique that direct          radio signal in specific direction      instead of broadcasting them in all     directions
   *simply*
   it focusee the signal towards a         particular user or device, improving    the quality and strength of             connection.

4. ## Full Duplex Mode of Transmission:-
    • In this, high speed switches are       used to control data transfer in        each direction by efficiently           switching one at a time and fully       utilising the existing spectrum        .The same frequency band can be          used for transmission and               receiving mode of operation .
