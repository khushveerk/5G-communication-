## ITU (International Telecommunication Union) 
It is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating global telecommunication standards, regulations, and spectrum allocation. It ensures that communication systems worldwide, including telecommunications, radio, and satellite, operate seamlessly and without interference.ITU-R manages radio telecommunication, ITU-T sets technical standards for global telecommunications.

ITU - R -- Radio communication 
ITU -T -- Standardization 
ITU -D -- Development 

## 3GPP 
(3rd Generation Partnership Project) 
•It is a collaborative initiative that develops globally accepted technical specifications for mobile telecommunications. 3GPP defines system architectures, protocols, and standards for mobile networks and works closely with telecom companies and other stakeholders to drive the evolution of cellular networks.

## 5G Use Cases:

1. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)

   •provides high speed internet access     and low latency
   
2.Massive Machine-Type Communications     (mMTC)
  
   •sports high density of online           devices
   •design to connect large number of       devices and IoT applications.

3.Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency              Communication (URLLC)
  [key feature of 5G]  
  
   •provides low latency and highly         reliable communication 
   •example- for factory automation,        AR/VR , Remote surgery.etc
