## MIMO 

involves using multiple antennas at both transmeter and receiver .It allows for receiving and sending more data at same time, improving the speed.


### TYPES :- 
1. Single user MIMO --- 1 sender and 1 receiver

2. multi user MIMO ---- 1 sender and many receivers.




## Beamforming :-

â€¢it is a technique that direct radio signal in specific direction instead of broadcasting them in all directions simply it focusee the signal towards a particular user or device, improving the quality and strength of connection.
